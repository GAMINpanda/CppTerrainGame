# CppTerrainGame

A fun project entirely made with C++ to help me learn the language.

Currently Can:
  - Generate Terrain From Seed (Improved and Faster than C# Procedural Bitmap)

Want To Implement:
  - Generate Kingdoms On Map (Including names and capital cities)
  - 'Zoom' to Generate Finer Details e.g. Zoom on (80, 20) reveals a quiet fishing town by a lake
  - Generate 'Lore' for the World

Future Ideas:
  - Introduce Tick system so World and inhabitants can change with time
  - Introduce 'Game' mechanic to allow User to travel the world as if an inhabitant
      ==> Will become main feature
